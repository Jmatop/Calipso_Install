For install all plugins and the program execute the bash file "install.bash" on /Calipso_Install/Calipso/ (you need to change the install.bash and put your home name)
 
 Now you can execute the command "calipso" on your terminal or go to the Calipso folder and use bash script2 "bash script2.bash". Now if you go to your local page you can see the graphic with all packets
